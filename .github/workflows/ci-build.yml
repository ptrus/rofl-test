# ROFL GitHub Actions Examples
#
# This workflow demonstrates all common use cases for the ROFL build/deploy action.
# Each job shows a different scenario - use the one that fits your needs.
#
# Required secrets (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Secrets):
#   - WALLET_SECRET: Mnemonic or private key for direct deployment
#   - SAFE_PROPOSER_KEY: Private key of a Safe multisig owner (for Safe mode)
#
# Required variables (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables):
#   - SAFE_ADDRESS: Safe multisig contract address

  # ============================================================================
  # SCENARIO 1: Validate Only
  # ============================================================================
  # Web2 equivalent: Linting or config validation (like `docker-compose config`)
  #
  # Use this to catch config errors early without waiting for a full build.

  # ============================================================================
  # SCENARIO 2: Build Only
  # ============================================================================
  # Web2 equivalent: `docker build` without `docker push`
  #
  # Use this to verify your app compiles successfully.

  # SCENARIO 3: Build + Verify (reproducible builds)
  # ============================================================================
  # Web2 equivalent: Verifying a Docker image hash matches what's in production
  #
  # Use this to ensure your local build produces the exact same artifact as
  # what's registered on-chain.

  # SCENARIO 4: Full Deployment (direct, single-key)
  # ============================================================================
  # Web2 equivalent: `docker build && docker push && kubectl apply`
  #
  # Use this for testnet or when a single deployer key is acceptable.
  # The wallet secret signs and broadcasts transactions directly.

  # SCENARIO 5: Safe Multisig Deployment (https://safe.oasis.io/)
  # ============================================================================
  # Web2 equivalent: Creating a deployment PR that requires multiple approvals
  #
  # Use this for production deployments where no single person should have
  # deploy access. The transaction is proposed to a Safe multisig wallet,
  # and other team members approve it via the Safe UI before it executes.

  #   - Safe variables configured (address, RPC, service URL)

  # ============================================================================
  # SCENARIO 6: Generate Unsigned Transactions (manual signing)
  # ============================================================================
  # Web2 equivalent: Generating deployment manifests for manual review/apply
  #
  # Use this when you need to sign transactions outside of CI, such as with
  # a hardware wallet (Ledger) or air-gapped machine. Downloads the CBOR
  # files as artifacts, which you then sign and broadcast manually.
